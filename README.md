# RichardCamp Full Stack Web App

This is a project made by coding along with the instructor in a course on Udemy (The Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele). I made this project in 2018 but I never have the oportuniy to share it on GitHub... I was very bussy with college, and now at April 2020 to much spare time with the quarantine life. 

JavaScript has changed since 2018, so the code is a little bit out of date, but the app still workig fine since today... and I using must of the principle I learned to build new projects.
